    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Caitlin and I am a designer at heart, but it has taken me a while to figure that out, which is why I have explored many career paths in my adulthood. My Bachelor’s degree is in Elementary Education. I also have a Master’s degree in Instructional Design and Technology. While obtaining my degree in Instructional Design and Technology, I found my true passion, which is design. That is why I am in UF’s Master of Arts in Web Design and Online Communication Program. If you are a designer and want to take your career to the next level by getting your Master’s in Web Design click the link below to look at the Web Design program that UF has to offer.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I am a self-taught artist. YouTube has been my best friend in teaching me all things art, such as calligraphy, drawing, and painting. When I am not designing you can find me hiking, exploring new places, trying out new coffee shops, and exploring the local cuisine scene in my town.</p>
    
    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <p>I have found that setting mini-goals makes it easier to reach your career goal.</p>
